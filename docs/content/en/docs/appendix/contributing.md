Thanks for your interest in improving Kythera!

There are multiple opportunities to contribute at any level. It doesn't matter if you are just getting started with Rust
or are the most weathered expert, we can use your help.

No contribution is too small and all contributions are valued.

The best way to make a contribution would be [to open an issue](https://github.com/polyphene/kythera/issues/new/choose)
related to a problem that you have faced or [open a new PR](https://github.com/polyphene/kythera/compare) with your suggested changes.

Eager to see what you have in store for us!
